Got a request from an old friend who is starting C#. He's interested in learning about crypters and such. I threw together this very simple "encoder" to show him the basics on data manipulation. Figured someone here may be able to learn from it. It's not new, Not groundbreaking, and not FUD. but, It's free and simple to understand. Oldschool external stub style. no CodeDOM involved.
